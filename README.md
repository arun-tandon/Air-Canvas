# Air-Canvas
Computer vision project implemented with OpenCV 
Draw your imagination by just waiving your finger in air 
We will be using the computer vision techniques of OpenCV to build this project.
The preffered language is python due to its exhaustive libraries and easy to use syntax 
Here Colour Detection and tracking is used in order to achieve the objective. 
The colour marker in detected and a mask is produced. 
It includes the further steps of morphological operations on the mask produced which are Erosion and Dilation. 
Erosion reduces the impurities present in the mask and dilation further restores the eroded main mask
